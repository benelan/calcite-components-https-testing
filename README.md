# Calcite Components HTTPS Testing

Created this repo to test an [issue with autofilling login credentials](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-components/issues/5022). To run the test:

```sh
npm i && npm run link && npm run build && npm start
```

Then open the browser and go to [`https://localhost:8443`](`https://localhost:8443`).
